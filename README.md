This repository contains Matlab scripts used for the analysis reported in the paper *"Slow Wave Sleep Drives Sleep-Dependent Renormalization of Synaptic AMPA Receptor Levels in the Hypothalamus."*

## Description

The provided Matlab scripts were utilized to:
  Detect sleep-related parameters during NREM sleep, including _Spindle density_ et al., 
  Analyze the correlations between these sleep parameters and AMPAR levels.

## Dependencies

- Matlab R2021a or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox
