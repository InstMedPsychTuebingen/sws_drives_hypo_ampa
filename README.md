This repository contains Matlab scripts used for the analysis reported in the paper *"Slow Wave Sleep Drives Sleep-Dependent Renormalization of Synaptic AMPA Receptor Levels in the Hypothalamus."*

#### Contents

The provided Matlab scripts were utilized to:<br>
 - Detect sleep-related parameters during NREM sleep, including _Spindle density_ et al., <br>
 - Analyze the correlations between these sleep parameters and AMPAR levels.<br>

#### Dependencies

- Matlab R2021a or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox
